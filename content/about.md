More than a decade ago, I was given the Buddhist name [Jigme Tsöndrü](/article/i-am-jigme-tsondru), and I've sought ever since to live up to that name. This site is my latest Weblog, wherein I try to document the ways I've engaged with the world around me through that name. Over the years--in fact, even reaching back prior to my being given that name--that's included academic research, community and financial development, organizational management, literature, phtotgraphy, and just trying to understand better and act accordingly.
